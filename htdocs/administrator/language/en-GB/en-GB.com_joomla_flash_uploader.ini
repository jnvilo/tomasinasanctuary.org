I_DESC=<p>The Joomla Flash Uploader (JFU) is the Joomla component of the TWG Flash Uploader. It enables you to upload files in a very comfortable way and offer this features in the backend AND in the front-end of Joomla. You can create upload profiles with different folders and settings and assign them to your Joomla users.</p>For more help please use the help of the component or go to <a href="http://jfu.tinywebgallery.com" target="_blank">jfu.tinywebgallery.com</a>.<p>To verify that the uploader works correctly please perform the following steps:<ol><li>Go to 'Components&nbsp;->&nbsp;Joomla Flash Uploader ->&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="?option=com_joomla_flash_uploader&act=upload">Upload</a>'</li><li>Check if the main directory of Joomla is listed on the left side. If not please log off Joomla and close your browsers and login again to get a new session.</li><li>If you get the message that the flash cannot find the configuration please go to the '<a target="_blank" href="?option=com_joomla_flash_uploader&act=help">Help / Limits</a>' page and check the file permissions of the tfu_*.php files (only available on non windows servers).</li><li>If you get the message 'The folder has no write permissions. All actions are disabled.' you have to change the permissions of the folder you want to upload that php can write to this folder. Most of the time you need 777 (sometimes 775 is enough).</li><li>Upload an image. If this does not work and the flash say you have to copy a .htaccess file please go to 'Components&nbsp;->&nbsp;Joomla Flash Uploader ->&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="?option=com_joomla_flash_uploader&act=upload">Upload</a>'. At the bottom of the page you can create this file, then retry.</li></ol></p><p>The flash is available in 18 languages right now (de, en, es, br, cn, ct, da, fr, it, jp, nl, no, pl, pt, ru, se, sk, tw). All of them are automatically mapped to the default language of Joomla. Please go to <a href="http://jfu.tinywebgallery.com" target="_blank">jfu.tinywebgallery.com</a> how to add your language.</p><p>To use the component in the front-end of Joomla simply add the component to your menu. You have to specify a profile id you want to use there. The profiles are defined at 'Components&nbsp;->&nbsp;Joomla Flash Uploader&nbsp;->&nbsp;Config'.</p><p>Have fun using JFU</p>

E_S_JFU_USE_JS_INCLUDE=Include the flash with Javascript
E_D_JFU_USE_JS_INCLUDE=In the frontend the flash is included by Javascript by default to avoid that users of 'older' versions of IE have to activate the flash. But sometimes this way interferes with other components. If you get an error message that the web site cannot be opened when you try to open JFU you should set this to false. JFU is then included with the good old object tag. Test with Vista and IE with 'Protected Mode: On'. If this works with Javascript everything is fine otherwise use the object tag.

Depending on the 'Master profile directory mode' either the user id or the user login is used as directory name. The directories are created with the default Joomla rights.

E_S_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD=Enable direct download
E_D_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD=If the downloads are corrupt or fail on https with ie you can enable direct download. Then the flash tries to get the files directly and not over php. The disadvantage is that the url has to be urlencoded and not all filenames are possible then - do only use this if the download does not work with the default setting. zip download does not work with this setting! I recommend to enable normalize for files and directories to have valid filenames.
E_S_FIX_UTF8=Fix encoding
E_D_FIX_UTF8=This is an advanced setting if the file encoding on your server is wrong. This can happen with Chinese and Japanese file names when you get ??? after the upload.

H_H3_HELP=Info
H_H_TEXT=This is not the help of Joomla Flash Uploader but some interesting things you might want to know.
H_H_OVERVIEW=<b>Overview:</b> The Joomla Flash Uploader (JFU) is a Joomla component that allows you to provide a very comfortable way to upload files with flash both in the backend AND the front-end of Joomla. You don't have to upload one file after another anymore but you can upload them all at once. You can specify different profiles and assign them to your users in Joomla. This makes it possible to give e.g. every user a different upload folder with even different settings!
H_H_HELP=<b>Help:</b> If the description on the pages are not enough click on the 'Help' button in the toolbar. This shows you always the latest help. It is only available in English right now but it should explain everything you need to know.
H_H_TWG=<b>TWG Flash Uploader:</b> JFU is a bridge to the TWG Flash Uploader where the whole configuration can be nicely made in Joomla. Therefore you can simply go to the TFU homepage to get more information what the flash can do and you get some more help there too.
H_H_FORUM=<b>Forum:</b> The TWG homepage has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/forum.php">forum</a> where you find an extra section for the JFU. Please report any problems/comment/questions there.
H_H_CONFIG=<b>Extended configuration:</b> The JFU configuration covers about 98% of the possible settings (and 100% of the important ones). If you open the my_tfu_config.php in administration/components/com_joomla_flash_uploader/tfu you find the remaining ones as comments. The file is well documented. Therefore it should not be a problem to make your changes of the remaining settings there.
H_H_MAMBOT=<b>Mambots/Plugin:</b> There is a Mambot/Plugin available. It needs a working component if you like to use it. A description can be found in the help.
H_H_REG=<b>Registration:</b> There are 2 version of the TWG Flash Uploader available: Freeware and the registered version. This is the same for JFU. Please read the section below for more details.

Please read how-to 4 on <a href='http://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/tfu/web_overview.php'>www.tinywebgallery.com</a> TWG Flash Uploader -> Installation & FAQ how to increase this limit.<br>0 means that no limit can be detected.

E_D_JFU_SESSION_DB=The Joomla session handler is set to 'database'. This should be changed to 'none' at Site -> Configuration -> System -> Session Handler. Otherwise you maybe have the following problems:<ul><li>Changes to the configuration are not used right away because the parameters are not updated in the db session</li><li>If you have 2 menu items with different profiles it is important to set 'none' because it can be possible that not the right profiles are shown.</li><li>You cannot read variables that are set by JFU. This is important if you want to use the Javascript call back functions to access the session variable 'TFU_LAST_UPLOADS' which is an array that contains the file names of the last upload.</li></ul>
