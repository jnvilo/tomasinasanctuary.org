Using the <b>Simple Image Gallery PRO</b> plugin from JoomlaWorks you can quickly display a folder of images (uploaded to your Joomla! site) as a stylish image gallery within any article. Use for example <b><i>{gallery}myphotos{/gallery}</i></b> inside the article, in which you want to display an image gallery of photos uploaded to the folder "myphotos". The plugin will then "automagically" present this folder as an image gallery, with selectable templates and "lightbox" like popups to showcase the original images, when users click on the thumbnails!<br /><br /><b>Simple Image Gallery PRO</b> is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a> plugin developed by <a target="_blank" title="Visit JoomlaWorks!" href="http://www.joomlaworks.gr">JoomlaWorks</a>, released under a commercial license.<br /><br />You may also want to check out the following resources:<ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.joomlaworks.gr/content/view/51/41/"><b>Simple Image Gallery PRO</b> documentation</a></li><li><a target="_blank" title="Visit JoomlaWorks!" href="http://www.joomlaworks.gr/">Learn more about all JoomlaWorks extensions for Joomla! and other systems</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/2056/details">Please show your support in our work by rating this extension at the official Joomla!
